## Technologies

- **React** - for building the user interface
- **useState** - React hook to manage state
- **CSS** - for basic styling (custom or framework, if any)

---

## Code Overview

The app contains a single component: `Counter`.

- **Counter Component**:
  - Uses `useState` to define a `count` state.
  - Includes functions for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter.
  - Provides three buttons: "Increment," "Decrement," and "Reset," which update the `count` value accordingly.

#### Example Code (Counter Component)

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(0);

  return (
    <div className="counter">
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
